# Bagakit Skill Maker

Build skills that are:

- standalone-first,
- rule-driven (not name-bound),
- easy to trigger correctly,
- lean in context cost.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to create a new skill repo from first principles.
- User asks to improve/refactor one existing skill with clearer trigger boundaries.
- User asks to merge multiple skills into one coherent portable skill.
- User needs payload/runtime boundary checks, standalone checks, or optional contract checks.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- User only needs one-off coding output and does not need reusable skill packaging.
- User asks for hard mandatory dependence on another skill flow in default mode.
- User asks for an all-in-one toolbox skill without a clear bounded problem.

## Granularity Principle (No Toolbox Skill)

- One skill should solve one clearly bounded problem, or one group of problems that share the same foundation.
- Do not build an all-in-one toolbox skill with weak boundaries.
- If boundaries blur, or trigger ambiguity rises, prefer split/merge refactoring:
  - split when one skill contains unrelated workflows,
  - merge when multiple skills duplicate the same foundation and can share one contract.

## Cross-Agent Goal

- Target a portable skill design that works across major coding agents (for example Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode-like runtimes).
- Compatibility should be achieved through generic file contracts, deterministic scripts, and explicit runtime assumptions.
- Never hard-depend on one specific agent surface as a required default path.

## Core + Bagakit Profile

- Core output should stay portable and system-agnostic.
- Bagakit profile is an optional compatibility layer that can map generic contracts to concrete Bagakit systems.
- Do not assume any concrete Bagakit skill is installed unless explicitly detected or requested.
- If target skill is a Bagakit-series skill (`name` starts with `bagakit-`), Bagakit profile is required (for example `[[BAGAKIT]]` footer contract).

## Constraint Budget (Guidance-First)

- For high-ceiling agent workflows, prefer guidance and examples over heavy structured schema constraints.
- If the work should be performed similarly by both agents and humans, and quality is mostly achieved by clear standards/examples, use a guidance pack.
- Use programmatic gates only for hard invariants:
  - standalone-first behavior,
  - protocol format invariants (for example RFDP shape),
  - runtime payload boundaries,
  - generated file path portability (no absolute path literals),
  - completion destination evidence.
- If a strict gate is required regardless of who executes, and extra autonomy does not improve outcomes, escalate to programmatic validation or strict SOP.
- Promote guidance to hard gates only when repeated production failures prove it is necessary.

## Metadata Contract Principle (Semantic-First)

- Prefer semantic generic keys over workflow-specific key proliferation.
- Bad pattern: one key per adapter/system (for example `driver_ftharness`, `driver_openspec`, `driver_longrun`).
- Better pattern: one semantic key plus parseable metadata:
  - `driver`: semantic token (`none` / `ftharness` / `openspec` / `longrun` / `custom`),
  - `driver_meta`: `none` or `key=value(; key=value)*`.
- Keep standalone defaults explicit and valid (for example `driver=none` with `driver_meta=none`).
- For machine-readable metadata blocks embedded in Markdown artifacts, prefer TOML frontmatter (`+++`), not YAML frontmatter (`---`).
- Exception: SKILL.md header/frontmatter stays YAML because runtime toolchains commonly expect YAML there.

## Open Discovery Principle (Avoid Closed-Door Design)

- For unresolved skill problems, discovery is mandatory before implementation.
- Use `references/skill-discovery-sources.md` as the default discovery playbook:
  1. define keyword sets,
  2. search ordered source layers,
  3. compare at least three candidates from the discovery yellow pages,
  4. log reuse/adapt/reject decisions.
- If discovery finds a suitable skill, install/adapt first; create from scratch only with a recorded gap rationale.
- If another discovery skill/tool is available, use it as an optional accelerator on top of the default standalone path.

## Decision Categories

| Category | Typical Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger boundary | Over-trigger / under-trigger | sharpen frontmatter + positive/negative examples |
| Granularity | Multiple unrelated workflows mixed | split or merge based on shared foundation |
| Contract coupling | Required direct call to other skill scripts | convert to optional schema/signal contract |
| Metadata contract | one key per adapter/system; hard-coded workflow fields | use semantic generic keys + parseable `*_meta`; prefer TOML frontmatter in machine-readable artifacts |
| Payload boundary | runtime/dev files mixed together | trim `SKILL_PAYLOAD.json` to runtime-only payload |
| Packaging contract | `package-skill` outputs unstable/non-deterministic path | enforce `<DIST_DIR>/<SKILL_NAME>.skill`, support `DIST_DIR` override |
| Path portability | generated files leak local absolute paths | use relative paths or environment-variable-based paths |
| Output/archive boundary | outputs exist but no final destination or completion gate | define output map + default route + adapter routes + archive gate |
| Delivery archetype | unclear handoff target; completion feels subjective | classify deliverable type + define completion destinations |

## Workflow

0) Search-first discovery before creation/improvement.
- Do not start implementation immediately for unresolved problems.
- Use `references/skill-discovery-sources.md` as the default discovery path.
- Do not assume any specific discovery skill/CLI is installed; keep discovery flow standalone.
- Search in this order:
  1. project-local docs/contracts and known skill catalogs first,
  2. reliable primary sources (official docs / standards / authoritative guides),
  3. broader community solutions (GitHub / Stack Overflow / technical blogs),
  4. experience-only writeups last.
- Prefer ready-to-use skills/tools/code before designing from scratch.
- If discovery finds a more suitable complementary skill, use it as an accelerator on top of this default search path.
- Record useful findings (source + key takeaway + applicability) to avoid repeated search.

1) Lock concrete use cases first.
- Capture 3-5 real user prompts that should trigger the target skill.
- Capture 2-3 neighboring prompts that should NOT trigger it.

2) Design trigger and scope.
- Write a specific `description` in SKILL frontmatter: what it does + when to use.
- Keep one skill focused on one operational job. Split if triggers diverge.
- If user asks to improve one existing skill, keep compatible semantics but remove ambiguity and redundant instructions.
- If user asks to merge multiple skills, combine overlapping workflows into one portable skill with clear sections and one validation contract.

3) Classify deliverable archetype and output routes.
- Decide the skill's primary deliverable archetype (for example execution/result-heavy, process-driver, memory/governance).
- Define mandatory output classes:
  - `action-handoff` (what should be executed/pushed forward),
  - `memory-handoff` (what should be summarized/deposited; can be `none` only with rationale),
  - `archive` (completion evidence + destination report).
- For process-driver skills, action-handoff can be "upstream system progression + downstream archive".
- For delivery-heavy skills, archive gate should require both execution completion evidence and memory deposition evidence.

4) Define output routes and completion archive gate.
- Define what outputs this skill produces (at least one action/output artifact + one summary/memory artifact when applicable).
- Define default output route when no external driver is detected.
- Define optional adapter routes for external systems (for example task driver / spec system / memory system), and keep them optional.
- If Bagakit profile is enabled, document concrete adapter mapping as optional examples only.
- Reuse guidance pack checklists/examples before adding any new hard schema constraints.
- Define archive gate: every output must have an explicit destination path/id before task can be marked complete.

5) Plan progressive disclosure.
- Keep SKILL.md as an execution map, not a giant handbook.
- Move deep details into `references/`.
- Put deterministic/fragile steps into executable scripts under `scripts/`.

6) Scaffold and edit.
- Run:
```bash
sh scripts/bagakit_skill_maker.sh init --name <skill-name> --path <output-dir> [--with-agents]
```
- Fill generated SKILL.md/references/scripts with project-specific content.

7) Enforce core constraints + Bagakit profile defaults.
- Run:
```bash
sh scripts/bagakit_skill_maker.sh validate --skill-dir <skill-dir>
```
- Ensure `SKILL_PAYLOAD.json` excludes `README.md` and only ships runtime payload.
- Ensure cross-skill interaction is optional and schema/rule-driven, never mandatory direct flow-call.
- Ensure `SKILL.md` keeps a bounded context budget (default hard gate: `<= 500` lines).
- Ensure `Makefile package-skill` honors `DIST_DIR` and emits artifact at `<DIST_DIR>/<SKILL_NAME>.skill`.
- Ensure generated runtime/docs files do not contain absolute path literals; use relative/env-based paths only.
- Ensure `SKILL.md` defines output routes + archive gate as completion criteria.
- Ensure archive gate explicitly names action-handoff + memory-handoff destinations.
- If Bagakit profile is enabled, ensure `[[BAGAKIT]]` footer contract exists; otherwise keep generic mode.

8) Iterate from production misses.
- If over-triggering: narrow frontmatter description with stronger boundaries.
- If under-triggering: add concrete trigger phrases and file/task examples.
- Promote repeated manual fixes into scripts or references.
- If granularity drifts, trigger split/merge with an explicit improve plan + verification matrix.

9) Project-local evolution.
- Bagakit allows project-specific skill recomposition.
- As long as there is a clear improve plan and verifiable checks, the project can evolve its own better skill set.
- Upgrading can be done by merging with the best upstream version (or replacing), then re-validating local trigger quality and contracts.

## Fallback Path (No Clear Skill Fit)

- If boundary is unclear, ask one clarification question about scope/trigger.
- If no reusable pattern is stable, execute the task directly and record why no skill route is chosen.
- If request conflicts with standalone-first constraints, provide a compliant alternative plus rationale.

## Output Routes and Default Mode

- Explicitly label deliverable archetype/type for this skill.
- Define output classes explicitly for every skill:
  - `action-handoff` (default destination + optional adapter destinations)
  - `memory-handoff` (default destination + optional adapter destinations, or explicit `none` rationale)
  - `archive` (location for completion evidence)
- Define a default route when no external driver exists (for example local `plan-<topic>.md` / `summary-<topic>.md`).
- Define optional adapter routes for external systems (for example task driver / spec system / memory system), or explicitly state `standalone-only/no-adapter`.
- If needed, add a Bagakit profile subsection that maps generic routes to concrete systems as optional examples.
- Ensure routing is rule-driven and fallback-safe, never hard-coupled.

## Archive Gate (Completion Handoff)

- Any produced output must have a resolved destination path or system id.
- Archive record must include action handoff destination + memory handoff destination (or explicit `none` rationale).
- Completion is blocked until:
  - action-handoff destination is explicit,
  - memory-handoff destination is explicit,
  - archive destination is explicit.
- Do not mark completion until archive evidence is present and destination is explicit.

## Design Guide

- Use progressive references:
  - `references/core-design-guide.md` (portable core rules; always apply)
  - `references/bagakit-profile-guide.md` (Bagakit profile overlay; required for `bagakit-*`)
  - `references/skill-discovery-sources.md` (search-first sources and strategy)
  - `references/guidance-pack-patterns.md` (recommended output/archive patterns)
  - `references/guidance-pack-anti-patterns.md` (what to avoid)
  - `references/guidance-pack-examples.md` (copy-ready examples)
- For generic/non-Bagakit skills, apply core guide only.

## `[[BAGAKIT]]` RFDP (Response Footer Driven Protocol)

- Use RFDP instructions to increase task-focused reasoning depth and produce structured observability evidence.
- Keep canonical shape unchanged: one `[[BAGAKIT]]` anchor + peer `- ...` lines (no nested bullets).
- Reuse existing lines from project context (for example `LivingDoc`, `LongRun`), and add new skill-specific lines only when needed.

Minimum pattern:

```text
[[BAGAKIT]]
- LivingDoc: <docs update/evidence>
- LongRun: Item=<id>; Status=<in_progress|done|blocked>; Evidence=<commands/checks>; Next=<resume command>
- SkillMaker: Scope=<create|improve|merge>; Evidence=<trigger tests + payload validation>; Next=<next concrete action>
```

Technique notes:
- `Evidence` must be concrete and executable-oriented (commands, checks, changed contracts), not vague summaries.
- `Next` must be one clear next action, so the next round can continue deterministically.

## Response Templates

### Create

```text
Result: created <skill-name> with clear trigger boundary.
Checks: validate pass + payload gate pass.
Next: run one positive and one negative trigger scenario.
```

### Improve

```text
Result: improved <skill-name> by tightening scope and removing ambiguity.
Checks: before/after trigger matrix + validate pass.
Next: observe one production round and collect misses.
```

### Merge

```text
Result: merged <skill-a>/<skill-b>/... into one coherent skill.
Checks: merge map + de-dup rationale + validate pass.
Next: run post-merge trigger matrix and adjust boundaries.
```

### No Clear Skill Fit

```text
Result: no stable reusable skill pattern identified yet.
Checks: fallback rationale recorded + standalone constraints reviewed.
Next: complete task directly and gather examples for future skill extraction.
```

## Output Contract

When asked to create/refactor a skill, output:
- target folder layout,
- final SKILL frontmatter + core workflow sections,
- runtime payload decision (`SKILL_PAYLOAD.json`),
- output map (what outputs, default route, adapter routes),
- archive gate design (completion criteria + destination reporting),
- granularity decision (keep/split/merge + rationale),
- improve plan and validation matrix,
- validation result with failed/passed checks,
- next iteration suggestions based on trigger quality.

## Non-Goals

- Do not introduce backward-compatibility shims unless explicitly requested.
- Do not hard-bind to one external system name if a rule/schema contract can solve it.
